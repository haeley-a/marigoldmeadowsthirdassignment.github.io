                <h1>Marigold Meadows - About Us</h1>
                <p>Our Story: 
                   At Marigold Meadows, we believe in the transformative power of flowers. Established in 2002 by 
                   floral enthusiasts Emma and William Greenfield, Marigold Meadows Floral Company has blossomed from 
                   a small local shop into a cherished destination for floral artistry. Inspired by the vibrant hues 
                   and delicate fragrances of nature, our journey began with a simple mission: to spread joy and beauty 
                   through the language of flowers.</p>
